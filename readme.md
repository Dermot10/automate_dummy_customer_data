# Automated script to create dummy data and add into the database

# The data is randomly generated partially from hardcoded list data and the rest number generated functions

# Script replicates previous project work and will be updated to be more robust and include more data for additional tables

# A few different sql statements have been added to test database for data.

# Further improvements- unittesting, additional table scripts,
